// then i have to use a if statement to return the key that has a truthy value
//i dont think il need another statement if the first statement is never true i can have it return undefined
//have two return statements one within my loop and one not within the loop if it finds the key then it will return it and finish the function
//if no key is found then i can use return undefined outside of the forloop which should activate after the forloop has tried to find a truthy
